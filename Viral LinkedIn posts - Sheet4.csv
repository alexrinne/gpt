10 ways to stand out in a hiring process (that don’t involve your,,
resume):,,
1 - Do Your Research,,
"Before an interview, spend a few hours researching the",,
"company and role. At a minimum, you should cover: Company",,
"mission, recent company news, recent market news,",,
"backgrounds of leaders, and backgrounds of interviewers.",,
Google is a powerful asset—use it.,,
2 - Embrace “I Don’t Know”,,
You can’t know the answer to every question. And you know,,
what? That’s ok. Don’t be afraid to say “I don’t know”—but,,
follow it with a plan to acquire that information. Ex: “I don’t,,
"know, but I’ll dig in and follow up via email.” Then actually",,
follow up!,,
3 - Leverage Warm Intros,,
Warm intros are the holy grail of a competitive hiring process.,,
Scan your networks for any connections to a company—use,,
LinkedIn for this!,,
4 - Prepare for “Why Us?”,,
"Interviewers inevitably ask, “Why us?”—make sure you're",,
prepared for it. Leverage your research. Write down 2-3 unique,,
points about the company that appeal to you. The more,,
"specific, the better.",,
,,
5 - Pass the Plane Test,,
There’s a common—and dated!—test in the hiring process:,,
“Would I want to sit next to this person on a plane for 6 hours?”,,
This was about being “normal”—but normalcy is overrated. Be,,
"yourself, but be sure to get across that you're kind and genuine.",,
6 - Cite Real Weaknesses,,
"Getting asked about your weaknesses feels like a trap, so we",,
tend to cite weaknesses that could be viewed as strengths. “I’m,,
"TOO detail oriented."" I once told a finance interviewer I didn’t",,
know accounting—but that I would learn it. That’s a real,,
weakness!,,
7 - Highlight Learning as a Goal,,
"When asked about your goals, always highlight learning. Lifelong",,
"learners tend to be great employees—they're interested,",,
"intellectually curious, and driven to do more than what is asked",,
of them. Emphasize your focus on lifelong learning.,,
8 - Ask Unique Questions,,
Most interviews end with a classic: “Do you have any questions,,
for me?” This isn’t a throwaway. It's an opportunity to show off,,
your differentiated initiative. Ask a unique question grounded in,,
your research on the company.,,
,,
9 - Personalized Thank Yous,,
"After an interview, always make it a point to send a thank you note",,
to the interviewer. It should be concise and direct. Include a,,
"specific, personalized detail from the interview— something you",,
found interesting or a key follow up.,,
10 - Stop Fearing Rejection,,
I’m not ashamed to admit that I’ve been rejected for more jobs,,
than I can count. It happens—you can’t be a fit for everything and,,
everyone. Stop fearing rejection and put yourself out there.,,

Different smiles can create different outcomes.,,

"affiliation', and 'dominance' smiles, using different facial muscle",,
combinations to make them.,,
#Reward:,,
The “Intuitive” and communicates positive emotions. #Affiliation:,,

#Dominance:,,

Still not convinced about the power of smiling?,,
,,

It can be learned.,,

Working from home can open a lot of opportunities for you. You,,
can get even more work done at home. 😁I have dedicated this,,
week to help people connect with more opportunities. I feel that,,
"when we are blessed with freedom and success, helping others to",,
find the same ..is the right thing to do.,,
I love working with a team and uplifting everyone around me (in,,
person & remotely). I also enjoy supporting innovative companies.,,
Remote work gives you access to opportunities beyond your local,,
community. This allows many people to connect with talent and,,
skills that they would never have had,,
access to.,,
Elon Musk recently asked his employees to come in to,,
work. Some positions may work best connecting in person.,,
"No matter what you decide is best for you, it is important to stay",,
connected and engaged with the people you work with.,,
Keep connecting with new people.,,
People with a strong network,,
have more opportunities.,,
Good news: working from home is working for a lot of successful,,
people and organizations!,,

How do Apple Pay and Google Pay handle sensitive card info?,,
The diagram below shows the differences. Both approaches are,,
"very secure, but the implementations are different. To understand",,
"the difference, we break down the process into two flows.",,
1. Registering your credit card flow,,
2. Basic payment flow,,
1 The registration flow is represented by steps 1~3 for both cases.,,
The difference is:,,
𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐥𝐞 𝐏𝐚𝐲: Apple doesn’t store any card info. It passes the card,,
info to the bank. Bank returns a token called DAN (device account,,
number) to the iPhone. iPhone then stores DAN into a special,,
hardware chip.,,
"𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐠𝐥𝐞 𝐏𝐚𝐲: When you register the credit card with Google Pay,",,
the card info is stored in the Google server. Google returns a,,
payment token to the phone.,,
"2 When you click the “Pay” button on your phone, the",,
basic payment flow starts. Here are the differences:,,
"𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐥𝐞 𝐏𝐚𝐲: For iPhone, the e-commerce server passes the DAN to",,
the bank.,,
,,
"𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐠𝐥𝐞 𝐏𝐚𝐲: In the Google Pay case, the e-commerce server",,
passes the payment token to the Google server. Google server,,
looks up the credit card info and passes it to the bank.,,
"In the diagram, the red arrow means the credit card info is",,
"available on the public network, although it is encrypted.",,
Over to you: Apple needs to discuss the DAN details with,,
"banks. It takes time and effort, but the benefit is that the credit",,
card info is on the public network only once. If you are an,,
"architect and have to choose between security and cost, which",,
solution do you prefer?,,

This is an open letter to anyone and everyone who is thinking,,

Shut up.,,

You know the first thing I do when I see public criticism of,,
salespeople? I check the poster’s work experience. And let me be,,
clear: If you want to publicly criticize salespeople without having,,
ever done this job?,,
Shut up.,,
If you take a second to look at YOUR OWN sales team you might,,
have a little perspective.,,
"Sales is HARD, people. IT’S SO HARD. That’s probably why YOU",,
don’t do it. Cold calls are scary. You are putting,,
yourself out there. Your entire professional life is getting rejected,,
while searching tirelessly for those wins big and small. THAT’S,,
WHY we get PAID.,,
"Don’t get me wrong, there are A LOT of BAD salespeople. Who",,
use bad tactics. Who should also:,,
SHUT UP.,,
,,
"But please, realize many of the cold-callers out there are early in",,
their careers and trying to learn. There IS a HUMAN on the other,,
end of those calls.,,
So be thankful for the sales reps who bring in revenue for YOUR,,
company so YOU can have a job.,,
And next time you think about publicly calling out salespeople,,
"for doing their job, how ‘bout this?",,
SHUT UP.,,

"Maximalist, Little Talent",,
"Group,",,
,,
"Over the last several years of my career I lost $300,000 dollars.",,
By failing to negotiate my salary.,,
My job search was fueled from a scarcity mindset.,,
"I often launched my job search out of PISSTIVITY for my role, lack",,
"of career progression, manager etc vs out of strategy aka ""moving",,
"on because it was time"".",,
I took an active role in cheating myself by:,,
,,
→ Accepting the first offer,,
→ NOT articulating my value,,
→ NOT asking the recruiter for the budget/range,,
→ NOT researching benchmark data,,
→ NOT comparing and contrasting benefits,,
→ NOT reviewing the new tax bracket my salary would push me,,
into and adjust my salary request accordingly,,
→ NOT considering the scope of responsibilities in relation to the,,
pay,,
"→ Convincing myself to take a low ball offer because it ""was the",,
"best I could get""",,
→ Sharing my previous salary with the recruiter saying something,,
"like ""I can't take less than I'm making"" sound like you?",,
,,
But it wasn't the best I could get when I discovered several,,
instances of co-workers in the same pay grade making upwards,,
of $40k cash or more than me.,,
,,
Or when I discovered that I was brought in at 50% of the pay,,
"position for my role even though I was ""over qualified"".",,
I cheated myself by assuming negotiations start at the point of,,
receiving an offer.,,
I was grossly mistaken.,,
"Negotiation starts at the point of speaking with the recruiter,",,
understanding the budget then providing your range that is,,
"considerably more than what you're making, and preferably a",,
range to set you up for negotiations LATER.,,
"When the recruiter shares the range, this is technically the first",,
offer made (high level of course) during the process.,,
"By sharing this range, you can determine if YOU want to invest",,
more time and it sets YOU up to share your desired salary range.,,
"This is called the anchoring principle. Look it up, it's similar to",,
"opening statements during a trial, and it works for salary",,
negotiations :),,
There is a strong correlation between that first discussion and,,
your final outcome.,,
"Here's the deal, companies, people etc. will pay you/treat you as",,
cheaply as YOU allow them to.,,
You have more of an active say in your career than you think you,,
do.,,
,,
Confusing what you're offered with what you are worth will,,
encourage you to use those pitiful numbers as your baseline for,,
your salary targets.,,
"Today's lesson is everything I did NOT do. Wash, rinse, and",,
repeat.,,
Fun fact: You can lose out on upwards of 1 million dollars by not,,
negotiating over the course of your career. Considering that we,,
"work over 50% of our lives, this is ALOT of money and a lot of",,
wasted time.,,
Assignment: Think of all the times you did not negotiate your,,
salary and you found out the full runway range for your role...add,,
it up and share your #'s below.,,

"Reese Witherspoon's production company, Hello Sunshine was",,
acquired for $900M,,
"She's a baller, but I wanted to know why she was able to",,
pull off this deal.,,
Here's what I was able to dig up:,,
"1. We're in the midst of a streaming war - Netflix, Disney and Hulu",,
are playing the long game - spending a ton of $$ to buy content,,
and outlast their opponents.,,
2. It's hard af to produce hit after hit. And platforms like Netflix +,,
Disney need hits to actually retain their,,
subscribers.,,
"Hello Sunshine has already created 2 Emmy-winning series, “The",,
Morning Show” for AppleTV+ and “Big Little Lies” for HBO so they,,
have a record of producing the hits these services need to remain,,
growth.,,
We all saw what happened to Netflix's stock after they reported,,
losing subscribers.,,
3. They generated around $120m in revenue in 2021 and is,,
expected to almost double that to around $310m in 2022.,,
"They not only bringing home bank, but they accelerating that",,
growth!,,
,,
"4. They are incredibly mission-focused, creating super fans. They",,
put women at the center at the center of every story and make,,
sure that they take the lead on-screen and off- screen.,,
"Content is produced for women across platforms, starring strong",,
"female characters, while being written and produced by women.",,
5. Reese Witherspoon's Book Club is an insane moat. It has 2.5,,
million members and she uses it to get data + feedback to create,,
more hit shows.,,
"Most of the time, she recommends books that she has already",,
met with the author to negotiate a deal where Hello Sunshine can,,
produce a film/TV adaption. If the book is crazy well received in,,
"the book club, she knows it'll be worth it to start production.",,
Reese know's her business basics: you gotta test that market!,,
6. Hello Sunshine's main business model is selling shows to,,
"streaming services (Netflix, Apple TV etc.)",,
Unlike other production companies that also have branding,,
agencies / sell to live TV / sell merchandise. Hello Sunshine is,,
laser-focused on creating shows that they then sell to streaming,,
services.,,
,,
Crazy impressive to see and curious to see which other,,
"celebrities will execute a similar playbook (Kevin Hart, Lebron",,
James and others all have 7 to 8-figure production companies),,

5 lessons from Netflix’s 67% decline:,,
1. Competition changes your market,,
2. Content CAN trump product,,
3. Entertainment is hits-driven,,
4. Big tech is always a threat,,
5. The tyranny of spend,,
"From 2011 to 2021, Netflix did not report a single quarter of",,
"decreasing subscribers. This year, it’s reported 2. In the",,
"process, it’s declined from $300B in market cap to $100B. For",,
"students of product growth, it’s an amazing case to study.",,
1. Competition changes your market,,
"In the first phase of the streaming wars, Netflix was dismantling",,
the dominance of cable TV. It could pay the major content,,
houses (like HBO & Disney) for the rights to their shows &,,
movies. That has changed with the entry of these players.,,
"In the new second phase of the streaming wars, each player is",,
keeping their content exclusive. You don’t see Stranger Things,,
"on HBO Max, Obiwan on Netflix, or Game of Thrones on",,
Disney+. This has changed the nature of the market Netflix plays,,
in.,,
2. Content CAN trump product,,
,,
"In this new market, Netflix’s higher quality streaming product only",,
"matters on the periphery. Sure, its search, smart downloads, &",,
home page algorithm are best in class. But the main turf for,,
competition has shifted to content.,,
This is a major takeaway for product leaders. Unlimited,,
optimization of every surface isn’t always how to move the needle.,,
3. Entertainment is hits-driven,,
There is a big difference between products that solve problems,,
"and products that entertain. For products that entertain, hits",,
matter.,,
Netflix’s outdated approach of Metacritic rated 40-70 niche,,
shows isn’t going to work anymore. Disney recently surpassed,,
"Netflix in subscribers due to its Star Wars, Marvel, and Pixar",,
blockbuster HITS.,,
4. Big tech is always a threat,,
Big tech has come in with its own hits. Arguably some of the best,,
new shows are from big tech: Apple with Ted,,
"Lasso, and Amazon with The Boys. Big tech is also a threat in",,
"markets Netflix WANTS to enter, like gaming & advertising.",,
,,
Big tech just completed a beat-down in ads. Apple’s privacy,,
"changes took the air out of stocks like Meta & Snapchat. Amazon,",,
"meanwhile, grew a $40B ads business in just a",,
few years. Always build a moat against big tech.,,
5. The tyranny of spend,,
"When a paid acquisition channel, like content budget,",,
"starts working, it can become tyrannical. The temptation",,
becomes: let’s just keep doing more of this. But this has led,,
Netflix’s economics to more closely resemble media than tech.,,
This has led to multiple compression. DTC companies have fallen,,
similarly. Their tyranny was performance marketing. SaaS,,
companies too. Those with expensive outbound sales motions,,
"have fallen. To maintain tech multiples, companies must generate",,
operating leverage as they grow.,,
This usually means: create a differentiated product. What if Netflix,,
had positioned its product as a $60 cable bundle,,
and compensated the competition more to stave off their entries?,,
Maybe it wouldn’t have worked. But maybe it could have.,,
Maybe it still can.,,

Was your pipeline down in April?,,
Ours is down 43% MoM.,,
I'm not mad about it. It makes perfect sense why.,,
That's what happens when the S&P 500 plunges nearly 9% in,,
"April, its worst monthly decline since March 2020.",,
That’s what happens when company valuations get slashed by,,
"more than 50%, shocking the system, making it much harder to",,
raise money and causing most companies to cut spending,,
dramatically to extend runways.,,
That's what happens when you compare March vs. April - March,,
being the last month of a major quarter for B2B buying cycles vs.,,
April being the first month of typically the slowest quarter for B2B,,
buying cycles.,,
"Oh, not to mention there's continued uncertainty &",,
growing risk that the war in Ukraine will tip a fragile global,,
economy into a slump.,,
If your pipeline is down month-over-month - sometimes it has,,
NOTHING to do with your Google Ads. It has nothing to do with,,
your content programs. It has nothing to do with Marketing at all.,,
It's sad to see companies blaming Marketing for missing the,,
pipeline number last month given the circumstances.,,
,,
It makes perfect sense why pipeline would be down in April and it,,
has nothing to do with Marketing performance.,,
#marketing #b2b #demandgen,,
p.s. A great way to measure this is to compare MoM,,
pipeline performance of other sources like outbound and partner.,,
If outbound and partner pipeline dropped similarly (oftentimes,,
"these sources drop more than marketing), that’s an indication that",,
"this is a BUSINESS problem, not a marketing problem.",,
But everyone needs a scapegoat and people love to blame,,
Marketing :),,
"p.p.s. Comparing Marketing Performance MoM is totally suboptimal and leads to knee jerk reactions, poor strategy decisions,",,
"and overall wasted time & energy worrying about nothing.""",,

Why hire students with 0 years experience?,,
- They’re great at working w/ limited budget,,
- Infuse new generational perspectives,,
- They can teach you something new,,
"- They bring a learning mindset, train them in critical skills to",,
remove single points of failure,,
- Someone asking lots of questions can inspire creative ideas for,,
change,,
- People excited to learn and work can positively boost your team,,
culture,,
"- Keep staffing, relocation, hiring costs low",,
- Improve the diversity of your team,,
- Give established employees the ability to grow through,,
mentoring and teaching,,
- Outsiders who haven't been brainwashed are the best people to,,
give feedback,,
"- Their experiences matter far less, and you focus on bringing in",,
greater character,,
"- They are the next generation, like it or not, you'll need them",,

The colour of my skin started to change two years ago...,,
I began to hide. No camera on video calls and no face to face,,
networking anymore. (And this had a massive impact on my,,
business because I was unable to fully be myself).,,
"As a usually quiet but confident person, the sudden onset",,
of my Vitiligo exacerbated my mental health which was already on,,
an emotional edge due to a huge personal change in my life.,,
I managed to get through this because I had a family around me,,
who loved me unconditionally.,,
The other massive pivotal change I remember was one of my,,
clients gave me the space to talk (via email) about these recent,,
changes and sent a really nice message which I'll remember for a,,
long time. It was probably a small thing for her. But a HUGE thing,,
for me.,,
The reason I post this today is for two reasons.,,
"1. It doesn't take much to be nice to someone else, and give them",,
the words of encouragement they probably need.,,
You don't know how much it will help their wellbeing.,,
2. It's emotionally draining trying to keep up with what you think,,
others think of you. Be yourself and be kind to,,
yourself. You're good enough. And others know this too.,,
